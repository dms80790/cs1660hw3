NOTES::: 
Screenshots are of my Azure account and attempting to run the WordCount program on Azure.  For some reason, bash was stuck on
20/04/18 03:48:22 INFO client.AHSProxy: Connecting to Application History server at headnodehost/10.0.0.20:10200.

I tried deleting my cluster to make a new one to resolve the issue, but Azure kept throwing an error saying I could not delete it,
which is also included in a screenshot.
